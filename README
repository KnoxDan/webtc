== WeBTC

This is a bitcoin online-wallet application based on the
bitcoind RPC API.

== Requirements

* bitcoind
* ruby 1.9
* rails 3
* database (ActiveRecord compatible; sqlite3, mysql, pgsql)
* GPG and GPGME

== Features

* list/display addresses
* list/display transactions
* label addresses
* send transactions (autocomplete labels)
* (of course it also receives transactions, but bitcoind does that for us :)
* key encryption (see below)

== Key encryption

Every user has a GPG key secured with his account password.
When a user signs out, all his bitcoin private keys are encrypted to this GPG key
and then removed from bitcoind.
When the user signs in again, he gives his password, the keys are decrypted and
loaded into bitcoind.
This way an attacker who compromised the server only has access to the currently
logged in users' money.

For this to work, you need a bitcoind that supports dumping, loading and removing
private keys. For the time being you have to use the 'showwallet' and 'removeprivkey'
branches from my git repo (git://github.com/mhanne/bitcoin.git).

== Setup

Install ruby 1.9 via your distribution, RVM or from source.
Install development libraries for your database.
Run `bundle install` to install all ruby libraries.
Run `rake db:migrate` to setup the database.
Edit config/application.rb and configure your bitcoind connection.
Create .gpg/ folder with chmod 700
Run `rails s` to start the webserver.
Open your browser at http://localhost:3000/
